The fast `collectstatic` for Django projects with S3 as storage backend.

Running Django's `collectstatic` command can become really slow as more and more files are 
added to a project, especially if heavy libraries such as jQuery UI are included in the source.
This is a custom management command that compares the md5 sum of files with S3 and completely
ignores `modified_time`. The results of the hash lookups are cached locally using your default
Django cache. This can make deploying much faster!


Installation
------------

Install the app using pip:

    $ pip install Collectfast

Make sure you have this in your settings file and add `'collectfast'` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`:

```python
STATICFILES_STORAGE = "storages.backends.s3boto.S3BotoStorage"
AWS_PRELOAD_METADATA = True
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    # …
    'collectfast',
)
```
For Django 1.7+, `'collectfast'` should come before `'django.contrib.staticfiles'`. For Django versions
below 1.7, it should come after `'django.contrib.staticfiles'`. Please note, that failure to do so
will cause Django to use `django.contrib.staticfiles`'s `collectstatic`.

_**Note:** `preload_metadata` of the storage class will be overwritten even if `AWS_PRELOAD_METADATA`
is not set to True see [#30](https://github.com/antonagestam/collectfast/issues/30)_


Setup Dedicated Cache Backend
-----------------------------

It's recommended to setup a dedicated cache backend for Collectfast. Every time Collectfast does not
find a lookup for a file in the cache it will trigger a lookup to the storage backend, so it's
recommended to have a fairly high `TIMEOUT` setting.

Set up your dedicated cache in settings.py with the `COLLECTFAST_CACHE` setting:

```python
CACHES = {
    'default': {
        # Your default cache
    },
    'collectfast': {
        # Your dedicated Collectfast cache
    }
}

COLLECTFAST_CACHE = 'collectfast'
```

By default Collectfast will use the `default` cache.

_**Note:** Collectfast will never clean the cache of obsolete files. To clean out the entire
cache, use `cache.clear()`.

Usage
-----

Collectfast overrides Django's builtin `collectstatic` command so just run
`python manage.py collectstatic` as normal. You can disable collectfast
by using the `--ignore-etag` option.

You can also disable collectfast by setting `COLLECTFAST_ENABLED = False` in
your settings file. This is useful when using a local file storage backend
for development.
